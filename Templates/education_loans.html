						<h4 style="color:#468E66">How do you take out a loan?</h3>

						<p style = "font-size:larger ; color: black ;">
							Federal loans are offered by the college upon submitting the FAFSA. If the college finds that the student
							qualifies for federal loans, an offer would be sent along with other financial aid, upon which the student
							 would have the option to accept or decline.
							If the student would like to take out a private loan, the most important thing is to do research!
							Private loans generally have higher interest rates and varying repayment plans, so the student would
							need to look for a loan that best fits their needs and financial status.
						</p>
						<br><br>
						<h4 style="color:#468E66">What are the different types of loans?</h3>

							<p style = "font-size:larger ; color: black ;">
								<b>Subsidized Loans</b> are loans for undergraduate students with financial need, as demonstrated by
								the cost of attendance and other financial aid. These loans do not accumulate interest
								while the student is attending college. The U.S. government covers the interest while the student is
								in college.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Unsubsidized Loans</b> are loans for graduate or undergraduate students that may or may not demonstrate
								financial need. The student is responsible for paying interest the entire duration of the loan. Interest rates
								for graduate students are generally higher than rates for undergraduate students.
								<br>
								<br>
								Subsized and unsubsidized are both federal loans. They have fixed interest rates, have flexible repayment schedules,
								 and most students are eligible for these loans. However, the amount a student can borrow is limited and decided by
								  the school.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Private loans</b> are nonfederal loans from the bank, credit union, state agency, or school. These loans are
								generally not as flexible as federal loans and interest rates may be higher. A co-signer is typically needed for
								these loans and a missed payment would affect the credit of both the student and the co-signer.
							</p>
							<br><br>
						<h4 style="color:#468E66">When should you pay back a loan?</h3>

							<p style = "font-size:larger ; color: black ;"> Students must start repaying their federal loan once they graduate, drop
								below half time enrollment, or leave school. They have a 6 month grace period before they are required to start
								making regular payments. However, there are certain circumstances that may affect the loan repayment, such as
								military enlistment and returning to school.
								Setting up a loan repayment plan may help one repay the loan
								in a timely manner. This allows them to avoid missed payments and potentially save money on interest.
								Staying in touch with your loan servicer is recommended in case the student misses or is going to be late on a loan
								repayment. You can
								read more about repaying student loans <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment" target="_blank">here</a>.
